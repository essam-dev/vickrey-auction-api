Kerdres Agency - Coding Kata - Vickrey Auction

# Expected result

Consider a scenario involving a sealed-bid second-price auction, with the following conditions:

- An item is up for auction, with a set reserve price.
- There are multiple potential bidders, each capable of placing one or more bids.
- The winning bidder is determined as the one whose bid, equal to or higher than the reserve price, is the highest.
- Only one bidder can win the auction.
- The winning price is the highest bid placed by any non-winning bidder that is above the reserve price. If there's no such bid, the reserve price itself is the winning price.

## **Instructions**

Your task is to create a program that models the scenario described above. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- Your program should accept two inputs and yield two outputs.
- Inputs: (1) Data representing the bidders and their bids (2) The reserve price.
- Outputs: (1) The winning bidder (2) The winning bid price.
- You are free to use any data structures that best represent the inputs and outputs.
- You can select any programming language for this task.

### **Example**

Let's consider 5 potential buyers (A, B, C, D, E) who compete to acquire an object with a reserve price set at 100 euros, bidding as follows:

- A: 2 bids of 110 and 130 euros
- B: 0 bid
- C: 1 bid of 125 euros
- D: 3 bids of 105, 115 and 90 euros
- E: 3 bids of 132, 135 and 140 euros

The buyer E wins the auction at the price of 130 euros.

# Test case

After starting the program locally, you can access to the swagger documentation to test the API.
The documentation is available at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html


The following curl command can be used to test the API:
```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v1/auctions/vickrey' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "bidders": [
        {
            "userName": "A",
            "bids": [
                110,
                130
            ]
        },
        {
            "userName": "B",
            "bids": []
        },
        {
            "userName": "C",
            "bids": [
                125
            ]
        },
        {
            "userName": "D",
            "bids": [
                105,
                115,
                90
            ]
        },
        {
            "userName": "E",
            "bids": [
                132,
                135,
                140
            ]
        }
    ],
    "reservePrice": 100
}'
```
