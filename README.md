Kerdres Agency - Coding Kata - Vickrey Auction

**1. Objective of this Google Form**

This form is designed to:
- Present coding kata #1 to interested candidates.
- Gather the completed code for subsequent review by Hugo.

**2. Premise**

Consider a scenario involving a sealed-bid second-price auction, with the following conditions:

- An item is up for auction, with a set reserve price.
- There are multiple potential bidders, each capable of placing one or more bids.
- The winning bidder is determined as the one whose bid, equal to or higher than the reserve price, is the highest.
- Only one bidder can win the auction.
- The winning price is the highest bid placed by any non-winning bidder that is above the reserve price. If there's no such bid, the reserve price itself is the winning price.

**3. Instructions**

Your task is to create a program that models the scenario described above. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- Your program should accept two inputs and yield two outputs.
- Inputs: (1) Data representing the bidders and their bids (2) The reserve price.
- Outputs: (1) The winning bidder (2) The winning bid price.
- You are free to use any data structures that best represent the inputs and outputs.
- You can select any programming language for this task.

**4. Example**

Let's consider 5 potential buyers (A, B, C, D, E) who compete to acquire an object with a reserve price set at 100 euros, bidding as follows:

- A: 2 bids of 110 and 130 euros
- B: 0 bid
- C: 1 bid of 125 euros
- D: 3 bids of 105, 115 and 90 euros
- E: 3 bids of 132, 135 and 140 euros

The buyer E wins the auction at the price of 130 euros.

**Important:**

What are we assessing with this Kata to be carried out in the language of your choice:
- The outcome; does it work and provide the expected results.
- The deliverable (source, "file", user manual, etc.)
- The code: its structuration/organization, quality (adherence to coding principles and standards), readability, potential optimization, etc.
